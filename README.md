# Quantum-Circuits-for-Desired-Bitstring

Proposing a new method where you can build quantum circuits based on the target strings. To be able to understand how to build this we have to go through it step by step

##Step 1: Manually Generated Quantum Circuit
here we manually assign the quantum gates to the qubits and also specify which quantum gate we are assigning.

##Step 2: Randomly Generated Quantum Circuit
Manually assigning quantum gates will be a very time taking process. This method then helps you automatically assign quantum gates to the qubits. All we need to specify is the number of qubits and gates.

##Step 3: Generating a list of Best Fit Quantum Circuits for the given Target Bitstring
Now that we figured how to generate quantum circuits automatically, this method then helps us generate best fit circuits for the given bitstring.

##Step 4: Quantum Circuits for Desired Bitstring
Finally, out of the list of best fit quantum circuits we generate just one circuit that can produce the given bitstring the most amount of times.

This method helps us come closer to target based quantum computing where we can efficiently use the parallel computation of quantum computing and lays some fundamental groundwork for further advancements in this field.
